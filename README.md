## Data 
After downloading the EndoVis'15 dataset, the dataset is separated into training (in *Tracking_Robotic_Training* folder) and test data (in *Tracking_Robotic_Testing* folder). The training data includes four 45 seconds ex vivo video sequences of interventions, the test set is composed of 15 seconds additional video sequences for each of the training sequence, and two additional 1 minute recorded interventions. The frame resolution is 720 Ã— 576 pixels. Frames examples are shown below:
